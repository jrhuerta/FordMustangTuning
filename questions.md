Questions:

Torque Model -> Monitoring -> IPC


Torque Maximun (30% up)
Torque Minimun * 0.9 ???
Torque vs Load vs RPM

MAP Maximun ???
MAP vs Load vs RPM

Do these tables need to be renormalized?


Torque management -> General -> ETC Torque Management = Torque management -> General -> Maximun Torque?
    -> Max Gross = Torque Max vs RPM?
    Torque vs Altitude Correction vs RPM
    Already maxed out.

    -> 2A, 3A, B, OP 2A, OP 3A, OP B = Scheduled Torque Max?
    Torque vs RPM vs Gear
    6 tables are identical multiplied by 2


Torque management -> General -> Desired Torque -> Normal
    -> PRN1, 2 -> 5%, 10%, 30% up on the last 3 columns
    -> The torque number on the other tables is already pretty high.
    

In the tutorial:

Airflow -> General -> MAF Calibration
    -> Cylair Anticipation -> Disabled
    -> Cylair WOT Multiplier -> 1.9
    -> Cylair Max Multiplier -> 1.9

Airflow -> General -> Desired Airmass
    -> Max Load -> from 1.0 -> 2.0
Why? 


Spark -> Advance -> MBT
    Do these need to be re normalized
